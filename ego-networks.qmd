# Ego Networks


If you want to analyze ego networks, then I can only recommend this
[book](http://www.raffaelevacca.com/egocentric-r-book/) by [Raffaele Vacca](http://www.raffaelevacca.com/).
Raffaele has given countless workshops on ego network analysis in R and his material should provide
you with everything you need.
