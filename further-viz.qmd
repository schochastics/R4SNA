The tutorial "Network Analysis and Visualization with R and igraph"
by Katherine Ognyanova [(link)](https://kateto.net/networks-r-igraph) comes with 
in-depth explanations of the built-in plotting function of `igraph`. 

For further help on `ggraph` see the blog posts on layouts [(link)](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/ggraph-introduction-layouts/),
nodes [(link)](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/ggraph-introduction-nodes/) and edges [(link)](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/ggraph-introduction-edges/) by `@thomasp85`. 
Thomas is also the creator of `tidygraph` and there is also an introductory post on his blog [(link)](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/introducing-tidygraph/).

More details and algorithms of the `graphlayouts` package can be found on my blog
