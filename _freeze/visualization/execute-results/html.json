This is helpful\n  for directed edges to not make the arrows disappear.\n- `legend.position` in `theme()` controls all legends at once. If you don't want to show a specific legend, \n use `guide = \"none\"` in the respective `scale_*` function.\n- use `scale_color_viridis_c()` and `scale_color_viridis_d()`. The viridis colour palette makes plots easier to read by those with colorblindness and print well in grey scale.\n\nThe stress layout also works well with medium to large graphs. \n\n![](assets/img/coauthor_cran.png)\n\nThe network shows the biggest componentn of the co-authorship network of R package developers on CRAN (~12k nodes)\n\nIf you want to go beyond ~20k nodes, then you may want to switch to `layout_with_pmds()` or\n`layout_with_sparse_stress()` which are optimized to work with large graphs.\n\n### use the ggforce\n\nThe `ggforce` package works pretty nicely with `ggraph`.

Instead of writing code, you simply use drop-down menus to assign \nattributes to aesthetics or change appearances globally. One great feature of the addin is that you \ncan adjust the position of nodes individually if you are not satisfied with their location.\nOnce you are done, you can either directly export the figure to png or automatically insert the code to produce the figure into your script. That way, you can review the code and hopefully learn something from it. Below if a demo that shows its functionality.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schochastics/snahelper/master/man/figures/snahelper.gif)\n\n\nTo use the addin, simply highlight the variable name of your network within an R script and\nchoose the SNAhelper from the Addins drop-down menu within RStudio. You can find more about the \nAddin on its dedicated [pkgdown page](http://snahelper.schochastics.net)\n\n## Advanced layouts\n\nWhile “stress” is the key layout algorithm in `graphlayouts`, there are other, more specialized layouts that can be used for different purposes. In this part, we work through some examples with concentric layouts and learn how to disentangle extreme\n\"hairball\" networks.\n\n### Concentric layouts\n\nCircular layouts are generally not advisable. Concentric circles, on the other hand, help to emphasize \nthe position of certain nodes in the network. The `graphlayouts` package has two function to create \nconcentric layouts, `layout_with_focus()` and `layout_with_centrality()`.\n\nThe first one allows to focus the network on a specific node and arrange all other nodes in concentric circles (depending on the geodesic distance) around it. Below we focus on the character *Ned Stark*.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggraph(gotS1, layout = \"focus\", focus = 1) +\n    geom_edge_link0(aes(edge_linewidth = weight), edge_colour = \"grey66\") +\n    geom_node_point(aes(fill = clu, size = size), shape = 21) +\n    geom_node_text(aes(filter = (name == \"Ned\"), size = size, label = name),\n        family = \"serif\"\n    ) +\n    scale_edge_width_continuous(range = c(0.2, 1.2)) +\n    scale_size_continuous(range = c(1, 5)) +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = got_palette) +\n    coord_fixed() +\n    theme_graph() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](visualization_files/figure-html/concentric-ned-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe parameter `focus` in the first line is used to choose the node id of the focal node. \nThe function `coord_fixed()` is used to always keep the aspect ratio at one (i.e. the circles are always displayed as a circle and not an ellipse). \n\nThe function `draw_circle()` can be used to add the circles explicitly.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggraph(gotS1, layout = \"focus\", focus = 1) +\n    draw_circle(col = \"#00BFFF\", use = \"focus\", max.circle = 3) +\n    geom_edge_link0(aes(width = weight), edge_colour = \"grey66\") +\n    geom_node_point(aes(fill = clu, size = size), shape = 21) +\n    geom_node_text(aes(filter = (name == \"Ned\"), size = size, label = name),\n        family = \"serif\"\n    ) +\n    scale_edge_width_continuous(range = c(0.2, 1.2)) +\n    scale_size_continuous(range = c(1, 5)) +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = got_palette) +\n    coord_fixed() +\n    theme_graph() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](visualization_files/figure-html/concentric-ned1-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n`layout_with_centrality()` works in a similar way. You can specify any centrality index (or any numeric vector for that matter), and create a concentric layout where the most central nodes are put in the center and the most peripheral nodes in the biggest circle. The numeric attribute used for the layout is specified with the `cent` parameter. Here, we use the weighted degree\nof the characters.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggraph(gotS1, layout = \"centrality\", cent = graph.strength(gotS1)) +\n    geom_edge_link0(aes(edge_linewidth = weight), edge_colour = \"grey66\") +\n    geom_node_point(aes(fill = clu, size = size), shape = 21) +\n    geom_node_text(aes(size = size, label = name), family = \"serif\") +\n    scale_edge_width_continuous(range = c(0.2, 0.9)) +\n    scale_size_continuous(range = c(1, 8)) +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = got_palette) +\n    coord_fixed() +\n    theme_graph() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](visualization_files/figure-html/concentric-weighted-deg-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n(*Concentric layouts are not only helpful to focus on specific nodes, but also make for a \ngood tool to visualize ego networks.*)\n\n### Backbone layout\n\n`layout_as_backbone()` is a layout algorithm that can help emphasize hidden group structures.\nTo illustrate the performance of the algorithm, we create an artificial network with a subtle group structure using `sample_islands()` from `igraph`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ng <- sample_islands(9, 40, 0.4, 15)\ng <- simplify(g)\nV(g)$grp <- as.character(rep(1:9, each = 40))\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe network consists of 9 groups with 40 vertices each. The density within each group is\n0.4 and there are 15 edges running between each pair of groups. Let us try to\nvisualize the network with what we have learned so far.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggraph(g, layout = \"stress\") +\n    geom_edge_link0(edge_colour = \"black\", edge_linewidth = 0.1, edge_alpha = 0.5) +\n    geom_node_point(aes(fill = grp), shape = 21) +\n    scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set1\") +\n    theme_graph() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](visualization_files/figure-html/island_stress-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs you can see, the graph seems to be a proper \"hairball\" without any special \nstructural features standing out. In this case, though, we know that there should be\n9 groups of vertices that are internally more densely connected than externally.\nTo uncover this group structure, we turn to the \"backbone layout\". \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbb <- layout_as_backbone(g, keep = 0.4)\nE(g)$col <- FALSE\nE(g)$col[bb$backbone] <- TRUE\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe idea of the algorithm is as follows. For each edge, an embededness score is calculated which serves as an\nedge weight attribute. These weights are then ordered and only the edges with the highest score are kept. The number of\nedges to keep is controlled with the `keep` parameter. In our example, we keep the top 40%. The parameter usually requires some experimenting to find out what works best. Since this\nmay result in an unconnected network, we add all edges of the union of all [maximum spanning trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_tree). The resulting network is the \"backbone\" of the original \nnetwork and the \"stress\" layout algorithm is applied to this network. Once the layout is calculated, all edges are added back to the network. \n\nThe output of the function are the x and y coordinates for nodes and a vector that gives the ids of the\nedges in the backbone network. In the code above, we use this vector to create a binary edge attribute that indicates if an edge is part of the backbone or not.\n\nTo use the coordinates, we set the `layout` parameter to \"manual\" and provide the x and y coordinates\nas parameters.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggraph(g, layout = \"manual\", x = bb$xy[, 1], y = bb$xy[, 2]) +\n    geom_edge_link0(aes(edge_colour = col), edge_linewidth = 0.1) +\n    geom_node_point(aes(fill = grp), shape = 21) +\n    scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set1\") +\n    scale_edge_color_manual(values = c(rgb(0, 0, 0, 0.3), rgb(0, 0, 0, 1))) +\n    theme_graph() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](visualization_files/figure-html/backbone-plot-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe groups are now clearly visible! Of course the network used in the example is specifically tailored to illustrate the power of the algorithm. Using the backbone layout in real world networks may not always result in such a clear division of groups.\nIt should thus not be seen as a universal remedy for drawing hairball networks. Keep in mind: It can **only** emphasize a hidden group structure **if it exists**.\n\nThe plot below shows an empirical example where the algorithm was able to uncover a hidden group structure. The network shows facebook friendships of a university in the US. Node colour corresponds to dormitory of students.\nLeft is the ordinary stress layout and right the backbone layout.\n\n![](assets/img/facebook.png)\n\n### Dynamic networks\n\nPeople regularly ask me if it is possible to animate a network evolution with `ggraph` and `gganimate`.\nUnfortunately this is not yet possible. But fear not! There is a way to still get it done with some \nhacking around the ggraph package. I will walk through this hack below but hope that it will eventually become obsolete.\n\nFor this part of the tutorial, you will need two additional packages.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(gganimate)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe will be using the *50 actor excerpt from the Teenage Friends and Lifestyle Study* from the [RSiena data repository](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/siena_datasets.htm) as an example. The data is part of the \n`networkdata` package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(\"s50\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe dataset consists of three networks with 50 actors each and a vertex attribute for the smoking behaviour of students.\nAs a first step, we need to create a layout for all three networks. You can basically use any type of layout for each network, but I'd recommend `layout_as_dynamic()` from my very own package {{graphlayouts}}. The algorithm calculates a reference layout\nwhich is a layout of the union of all networks and individual layouts based on stress minimization and combines those in a linear combination which is controlled by the `alpha` parameter. For `alpha=1`, only the reference layout is used and all graphs have the same layout. For `alpha=0`, the stress layout of each individual graph is used. Values in-between interpolate between the two layouts.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nxy <- layout_as_dynamic(s50, alpha = 0.2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nThis graph was created by an old(er) igraph version.\n  Call upgrade_graph() on it to use with the current igraph version\n  For now we convert it on the fly...\nThis graph was created by an old(er) igraph version.\n  Call upgrade_graph() on it to use with the current igraph version\n  For now we convert it on the fly...\nThis graph was created by an old(er) igraph version.\n  Call upgrade_graph() on it to use with the current igraph version\n  For now we convert it on the fly...\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow you could use {{ggraph}} and {{patchwork}} to produce a static plot with all networks side-by-side.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npList <- vector(\"list\", length(s50))\n\nfor (i in 1:length(s50)) {\n    pList[[i]] <- ggraph(s50[[i]], layout = \"manual\", x = xy[[i]][, 1], y = xy[[i]][, 2]) +\n        geom_edge_link0(edge_linewidth = 0.6, edge_colour = \"grey66\") +\n        geom_node_point(shape = 21, aes(fill = as.factor(smoke)), size = 6) +\n        geom_node_text(label = 1:50, repel = FALSE, color = \"white\", size = 4) +\n        scale_fill_manual(\n            values = c(\"forestgreen\", \"grey25\", \"firebrick\"),\n            guide = ifelse(i != 2, \"none\", \"legend\"),\n            name = \"smoking\",\n            labels = c(\"never\", \"occasionally\", \"regularly\")\n        ) +\n        theme_graph() +\n        theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n        labs(title = paste0(\"Wave \", i))\n}\n\nwrap_plots(pList)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](visualization_files/figure-html/static_plot-1.png){width=1344}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis is nice but of course we want to animate the changes.

For instance, one level could be scientists and their collaborative ties and the\nsecond level are labs and ties among them, and inter-level edges are the affiliations of scientists and labs. \n\nThe `graphlayouts` package contains an artificial multilevel network which will be used to illustrate the algorithm.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(\"multilvl_ex\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe package assumes that a multilevel network has a vertex attribute called `lvl` which\nholds the level information (1 or 2). \n\nThe underlying algorithm of `layout_as_multilevel()` has three different versions, \nwhich can be used to emphasize different structural features of a multilevel network.\n\nIndependent of which option is chosen, the algorithm internally produces a 3D layout, where\neach level is positioned on a different y-plane. The 3D layout is then mapped to 2D with an [isometric projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric_projection).\nThe parameters `alpha` and `beta` control the perspective of the projection.\nThe default values seem to work for many instances, but may not always be optimal. \nAs a rough guideline: `beta` rotates the plot around the y axis (in 3D) and `alpha` moves the POV up or down.\n\n#### Complete layout\n\nA layout for the complete network can be computed via `layout_as_multilevel()` setting `type = \"all\"`.\nInternally, the algorithm produces a constrained 3D stress layout (each level on a different y plane) which is then \nprojected to 2D. This layout ignores potential differences in each level and optimizes only the overall layout.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nxy <- layout_as_multilevel(multilvl_ex, type = \"all\", alpha = 25, beta = 45)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nThis graph was created by an old(er) igraph version.\n  Call upgrade_graph() on it to use with the current igraph version\n  For now we convert it on the fly...\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo visualize the network with `ggraph`, you may want to draw the edges for each level (and inter level edges)\nwith a different edge geom.

Further reading\n\nThe tutorial \"Network Analysis and Visualization with R and igraph\"\nby Katherine Ognyanova [(link)](https://kateto.net/networks-r-igraph) comes with \nin-depth explanations of the built-in plotting function of `igraph`. \n\nFor further help on `ggraph` see the blog posts on layouts [(link)](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/ggraph-introduction-layouts/),\nnodes [(link)](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/ggraph-introduction-nodes/) and edges [(link)](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/ggraph-introduction-edges/) by `@thomasp85`. \nThomas is also the creator of `tidygraph` and there is also an introductory post on his blog [(link)](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/introducing-tidygraph/).\n\nMore details and algorithms of the `graphlayouts`
