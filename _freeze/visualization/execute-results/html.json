But when it comes to visualizing\nnetworks, R may lack behind some standalone software tools. Not because it is not possible to produce nice\nfigures, but rather because it requires some time to obtain pleasing results.\nJust take a look at the default output when plotting a network with the `plot()` function.\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'igraph'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    decompose, spectrum\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nThe following object is masked from 'package:base':\n\n    union\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(networkdata)\ndata(\"got\")\n\ngotS1 <- got[[1]]\nplot(gotS1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nThis graph was created by an old(er) igraph version.\n  Call upgrade_graph() on it to use with the current igraph version\n  For now we convert it on the fly...\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](visualization_files/figure-html/plot_ugly-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt is definitely possible to produce nice figures with the igraph package (Check out [this](https://kateto.net/networks-r-igraph) wonderful tutorial), yet it may take some time\nto familiarize yourself with the syntax. Additionally, most of the layout algorithms of `igraph` \nare non-deterministic. This means that running the same plot call twice may produce different results.\n\nIn this part, you will learn the basics of `ggraph`, the \"`ggplot2` of networks\", together with\nthe `graphlayouts` package, which introduces additional useful layout algorithms to R. \nArguably, using `ggraph` is not really easier than `igraph`. But once the underlying \nprinciple of the *grammar of graphics* is understood, you'll see that it is actually quite intuitive to work with. \n\n## Required libraries\n\nTo run all the code in this tutorial, you need to install and load several packages.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(c(\"igraph\", \"graphlayouts\", \"ggraph\", \"ggforce\"))\ndevtools::install_github(\"schochastics/networkdata\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nMake sure you have at least the version given below.

Each layer adds a new feature to the plot and thus builds the figure\nstep-by-step. We will work through each of the layers separately in the following sections.  \n\n### Layout\n\n```r\nggraph(gotS1, layout = \"stress\")\n```\n\nThe first step is to compute a layout. The layout parameter specifies the algorithm to use. \nThe \"stress\" layout is part of the `graphlayouts` package and is always a safe choice \nsince it is deterministic and produces nice layouts for almost any graph.\nI would recommend to use it as your default choice. Other algorithms for, e.g., concentric layouts and clustered networks\nare described further down in this tutorial. For the sake of completeness, here is a list of layout algorithms of \n`igraph`.\n\n```r\nc(\n  \"layout_with_dh\", \"layout_with_drl\", \"layout_with_fr\",\n  \"layout_with_gem\", \"layout_with_graphopt\", \"layout_with_kk\",\n  \"layout_with_lgl\", \"layout_with_mds\", \"layout_with_sugiyama\",\n  \"layout_as_bipartite\", \"layout_as_star\", \"layout_as_tree\"\n)\n```\n\nTo use them, you just need the last part of the name.\n```r\nggraph(gotS1, layout = \"dh\") +\n  ...\n```\n\nNote that there technically is no right or wrong choice. All layout algorithms are in a sense arbitrary since \nwe can choose x and y coordinates freely (compare this to ordinary data!). It is all mostly about aesthetics.\n\nYou can also precompute the layout with the `create_layout()` function. This makes sense in cases where the calculation\nof the layout takes very long and you want to play around with other visual aspects. \n```r\ngotS1_layout <- create_layout(gotS1 = \"stress\")\n\nggraph(gotS1_layout) +\n  ...\n```\n\n### Edges\n\n```r\ngeom_edge_link0(aes(width = weight), edge_colour = \"grey66\")\n```\n\nThe second layer specifies how to draw the edges. Edges can be drawn in many different ways as the list below shows.\n```r\nc(\n  \"geom_edge_arc\", \"geom_edge_arc0\", \"geom_edge_arc2\", \"geom_edge_density\",\n  \"geom_edge_diagonal\", \"geom_edge_diagonal0\", \"geom_edge_diagonal2\",\n  \"geom_edge_elbow\", \"geom_edge_elbow0\", \"geom_edge_elbow2\", \"geom_edge_fan\",\n  \"geom_edge_fan0\", \"geom_edge_fan2\", \"geom_edge_hive\", \"geom_edge_hive0\",\n  \"geom_edge_hive2\", \"geom_edge_link\", \"geom_edge_link0\", \"geom_edge_link2\",\n  \"geom_edge_loop\", \"geom_edge_loop0\"\n)\n```\nYou can do a lot of fancy things with these `geoms` but for a standard network plot,\nyou should always stick with `geom_edge_link0` since it simply draws a straight line between the endpoints. Some tools draw curved edges by default. While this may add some artistic value, it reduces readability. Always go with straight lines! If your network has multiple edges between two nodes, then you can switch to `geom_edge_parallel()`.\n\nIn case you are wondering what the \"0\" stands for: The standard `geom_edge_link()` draws 100 dots on each edge compared to only two dots (the endpoints) in `geom_edge_link0()`.\nThis is done to allow, e.g., gradients along the edge. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: The dot-dot notation (`..index..`) was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `after_stat(index)` instead.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](visualization_files/figure-html/got-plot-grad-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou can reproduce this figure by substituting  \n```r\ngeom_edge_link(aes(edge_alpha = ..index..), edge_colour = \"black\")\n```\nin the code above. \n\nThe drawback of using `geom_edge_link()` is that the time to render the plot increases and so \ndoes the size of the file if you export the plot ([example](https://twitter.com/schochastics/status/1091355396265201664))\nTypically, you do not need gradients along an edge. Hence, `geom_edge_link0()` should be your default choice\nto draw edges.\n\nWithin `geom_edge_link0`, you can specify the appearance of the edge, either by mapping edge attributes to aesthetics\nor setting them globally for the graph. Mapping attributes to aesthetics is done within `aes()`.\nIn the example, we map the edge width to the edge attribute \"weight\". `ggraph` then automatically scales the\nedge width according to the attribute. The colour of all edges is globally set to \"grey66\".\n\nThe following aesthetics can be used within `geom_edge_link0` either within `aes()` or globally:\n\n- edge_colour (colour of the edge)\n- edge_linewidth  (width of the edge)\n- edge_linetype (linetype of the edge, defaults to \"solid\")\n- edge_alpha (opacity; a value between 0 and 1)\n\n`ggraph` does not automatically draw arrows if your graph is directed. You need to do this manually using \nthe arrow parameter.\n```r\ngeom_edge_link0(aes(...), ...,\n  arrow = arrow(\n    angle = 30, length = unit(0.15, \"inches\"),\n    ends = \"last\", type = \"closed\"\n  )\n)\n```\n\nThe default arrowhead type is \"open\", yet \"closed\" usually has a nicer appearance.\n\n### Nodes\n\n```r\ngeom_node_point(aes(fill = clu, size = size), shape = 21) +\n  geom_node_text(aes(filter = size >= 26, label = name), family = \"serif\")\n```\n\nOn top of the edge layer, we draw the node layer. Always draw the node layer above \nthe edge layer. Otherwise, edges will be visible on top of nodes.\nThere are slightly less geoms available for nodes.\n\n```r\nc(\n  \"geom_node_arc_bar\", \"geom_node_circle\", \"geom_node_label\",\n  \"geom_node_point\", \"geom_node_text\", \"geom_node_tile\", \"geom_node_treemap\"\n)\n```\n\nThe most important ones here are `geom_node_point()` to draw nodes as simple geometric objects (circles, squares,...)\nand `geom_node_text()` to add node labels. You can also use `geom_node_label()`, but this draws labels within a box.\n\nThe mapping of node attributes to aesthetics is similar to edge attributes. In the example code, we map the fill attribute of the node shape to the \"clu\" attribute, which holds the result of a clustering, and the size of the nodes to the attribute \"size\". The shape of the node is globally set to 21.\n\nThe figure below shows all possible shapes that can be used for the nodes.\n\n![](assets/img/points-symbols.png)\n\nPersonally, I prefer \"21\" since it draws a border around the nodes. If you prefer another\nshape, say \"19\", you have to be aware of several things. To change the color of shapes 1-20,\nyou need to use the colour parameter. For shapes 21-25 you need to use fill. The colour parameter \nonly controls the border for these cases. \n\nThe following aesthetics can be used within `geom_node_point()` either within `aes()` or globally:\n\n- alpha  (opacity; a value between 0 and 1)\n- colour (colour of shapes 0-20 and border colour for 21-25)\n- fill  (fill colour for shape 21-25)\n- shape (node shape; a value between 0 and 25)\n- size (size of node)\n- stroke (size of node border)\n\nFor `geom_node_text()`, there are a lot more options available, but the most important once are:\n\n- label (attribute to be displayed as node label)\n- colour (text colour)\n- family (font to be used)\n- size (font size)\n\nNote that we also used a filter within `aes()` of `geom_node_text()`. The filter \nparameter allows you to specify a rule for when to apply the aesthetic mappings.\nThe most frequent use case is for node labels (but can also be used for edges or nodes).\nIn the example, we only display the node label if the size attribute is larger than 26.\n\n### Scales\n\n```r\nscale_fill_manual(values = got_palette) +\n  scale_edge_width_continuous(range = c(0.2, 3)) +\n  scale_size_continuous(range = c(1, 6))\n```\n\nThe `scale_*` functions are used to control aesthetics that are mapped within `aes()`.\nYou do not necessarily need to set them, since `ggraph` can take care of it automatically.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggraph(gotS1, layout = \"stress\") +\n  geom_edge_link0(aes(edge_linewidth = weight), edge_colour = \"grey66\") +\n  geom_node_point(aes(fill = clu, size = size), shape = 21) +\n  geom_node_text(aes(filter = size >= 26, label = name), family = \"serif\") +\n  theme_graph() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](visualization_files/figure-html/no-scales-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhile the node fill and size seem reasonable, the edges are a little too thick.\nIn general, it is always a good idea to add a `scale_*` for each aesthetic within `aes()`.\n\nWhat kind of `scale_*` function you need depends on the aesthetic and on the type of attribute you are mapping.\nGenerally, scale functions are structured like this:  \n`scale_<aes>_<variable type>()`.  \n\nThe \"aes\" part is easy. Just us the type you specified within `aes()`. For edges, however, you have to prepend `edge_`.\nThe \"variable type\" part depends on which scale the attribute is on. Before we continue, it may be \na good idea to briefly discuss what aesthetics make sense for which variable type. \n\n| aesthetic | variable type | notes |\n|--------|----------|--------------|\n| node size | continuous | |\n| edge width| continuous| |\n| node colour/fill | categorical/continuous | use a gradient for continuous variables|\n| edge colour | continuous | categorical only if there are different types of edges |\n| node shape | categorical| only if there are a few categories (1-5). Colour should be the preferred choice|\n| edge linetype| categorical | only if there are a few categories (1-5). Colour should be the preferred choice|\n| node/edge alpha| continuous | |\n\nThe easiest to use scales are those for continuous variables mapped to edge width and node size (also the alpha value, which is not used here). While there are several parameters within `scale_edge_width_continuous()` and `scale_size_continuous()`, the\nmost important one is \"range\" which fixes the minimum and maximum width/size. It usually suffices to\nadjust this parameter.\n\nFor continuous variables that are mapped to node/edge colour, you can use `scale_colour_gradient()`\n`scale_colour_gradient2()` or `scale_colour_gradientn()` (add edge_ before colour for edge colours).\nThe difference between these functions is in how the gradient is constructed. `gradient` creates a two\ncolour gradient (low-high). Simply specify the the two colours to be used (e.g. low = \"blue\", high = \"red\").\n`gradient2` creates a diverging colour gradient (low-mid-high) (e.g. low = \"blue\", mid = \"white\", high = \"red\") \nand `gradientn` a gradient consisting of more than three colours (specified with the colours parameter).\n\nFor categorical variables that are mapped to node colours (or fill in our example), you can\nuse `scale_fill_manual()`. This forces you to choose a color for each category yourself. \nSimply create a vector of colors (see the got_palette) and pass it to the function with the parameter values.\n\n`ggraph` then assigns the colors in the order of the unique values of the categorical variable. This \nare either the factor levels (if the variable is a factor) or the result of sorting the unique values (if the variable is a character).\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsort(unique(V(gotS1)$clu))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" \"5\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nIf you want more control over which value is mapped to which colour, you can pass the vector of colours\nas a named vector.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngot_palette2 <- c(\n    \"5\" = \"#1A5878\", \"3\" = \"#C44237\", \"2\" = \"#AD8941\",\n    \"1\" = \"#E99093\", \"4\" = \"#50594B\", \"7\" = \"#8968CD\", \"6\" = \"#9ACD32\"\n)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](visualization_files/figure-html/got-plot-pal2-1.png){width=1248}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nUsing your own colour palette gives your network a unique touch. If you can't be bothered with \nchoosing colours, you may want to consider `scale_fill_brewer()` and `scale_colour_brewer()`.\nThe function offers all palettes available at [colorbrewer2.org](http://colorbrewer2.org/). \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggraph(gotS1, layout = \"stress\") +\n  geom_edge_link0(aes(edge_linewidth = weight), edge_colour = \"grey66\") +\n  geom_node_point(aes(fill = clu, size = size), shape = 21) +\n  geom_node_text(aes(filter = size >= 26, label = name), family = \"serif\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\") +\n  scale_edge_width_continuous(range = c(0.2, 3)) +\n  scale_size_continuous(range = c(1, 6)) +\n  theme_graph() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](visualization_files/figure-html/got-plot-brewer-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n(*Check out this [github repo](https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/r-color-palettes) from Emil Hvitfeldt for a comprehensive list of color palettes available in R*)\n\n### Themes\n\n```r\ntheme_graph() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\nthemes control the overall look of the plot. There are a lot of options within the `theme()`\nfunction of `ggplot2`. Luckily, we really don't need any of those. `theme_graph()` is used\nto erase all of the default ggplot theme (e.g. axis, background, grids, etc.) since they are irrelevant for networks. \nThe only option worthwhile in `theme()` is `legend.position`, which we set to \"none\", i.e. don't show the legend.\n\nThe code below gives an example for a plot with a legend.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggraph(gotS1, layout = \"stress\") +\n  geom_edge_link0(aes(edge_linewidth = weight), edge_colour = \"grey66\") +\n  geom_node_point(aes(fill = clu, size = size), shape = 21) +\n  geom_node_text(aes(filter = size >= 26, label = name), family = \"serif\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = got_palette) +\n  scale_edge_width_continuous(range = c(0.2, 3)) +\n  scale_size_continuous(range = c(1, 6)) +\n  theme_graph() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](visualization_files/figure-html/got-plot-legend-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Another full example\n\nLet us work through one more visualization using a very special data set.

You may need to experiment a bit with\nthe parameter, but for this network, `bbox=15` seems to work best (see below).\n\nWe will use this network to quickly illustrate what can be done with `geom_edge_link2()`.\nThe function allows to interpolate node attributes between the start and end node \nalong the edges. In the code below, we use the \"position\" attribute. The line which adds the\nnode labels illustrates two further features of `ggraph`. First, aesthetics don't need to be \nnode attributes.

This is helpful\n  for directed edges to not make the arrows disappear.\n- `legend.position` in `theme()` controls all legends at once. If you don't want to show a specific legend, \n use `guide = \"none\"` in the respective `scale_*` function.\n- use `scale_color_viridis_c()` and `scale_color_viridis_d()`. The viridis colour palette makes plots easier to read by those with colorblindness and print well in grey scale.\n\nThe stress layout also works well with medium to large graphs. \n\n![](assets/img/coauthor_cran.png)\n\nThe network shows the biggest componentn of the co-authorship network of R package developers on CRAN (~12k nodes)\n\nIf you want to go beyond ~20k nodes, then you may want to switch to `layout_with_pmds()` or\n`layout_with_sparse_stress()` which are optimized to work with large graphs.\n\n### use the ggforce\n\nThe `ggforce` package works pretty nicely with `ggraph`.

One great feature of the addin is that you \ncan adjust the position of nodes individually if you are not satisfied with their location.\nOnce you are done, you can either directly export the figure to png or automatically insert the code to produce the figure into your script. That way, you can review the code and hopefully learn something from it. Below if a demo that shows its functionality.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schochastics/snahelper/master/man/figures/snahelper.gif)\n\n\nTo use the addin, simply highlight the variable name of your network within an R script and\nchoose the SNAhelper from the Addins drop-down menu within RStudio. You can find more about the \nAddin on its dedicated [pkgdown page](http://snahelper.schochastics.net)\n\n## Advanced layouts\n\nWhile “stress” is the key layout algorithm in `graphlayouts`, there are other, more specialized layouts that can be used for different purposes. In this part, we work through some examples with concentric layouts and learn how to disentangle extreme\n\"hairball\" networks.\n\n### Concentric layouts\n\nCircular layouts are generally not advisable. Concentric circles, on the other hand, help to emphasize \nthe position of certain nodes in the network. The `graphlayouts` package has two function to create \nconcentric layouts, `layout_with_focus()` and `layout_with_centrality()`.\n\nThe first one allows to focus the network on a specific node and arrange all other nodes in concentric circles (depending on the geodesic distance) around it. Below we focus on the character *Ned Stark*.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggraph(gotS1, layout = \"focus\", focus = 1) +\n    geom_edge_link0(aes(edge_linewidth = weight), edge_colour = \"grey66\") +\n    geom_node_point(aes(fill = clu, size = size), shape = 21) +\n    geom_node_text(aes(filter = (name == \"Ned\"), size = size, label = name),\n        family = \"serif\"\n    ) +\n    scale_edge_width_continuous(range = c(0.2, 1.2)) +\n    scale_size_continuous(range = c(1, 5)) +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = got_palette) +\n    coord_fixed() +\n    theme_graph() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](visualization_files/figure-html/concentric-ned-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe parameter `focus` in the first line is used to choose the node id of the focal node. \nThe function `coord_fixed()` is used to always keep the aspect ratio at one (i.e. the circles are always displayed as a circle and not an ellipse). \n\nThe function `draw_circle()` can be used to add the circles explicitly.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggraph(gotS1, layout = \"focus\", focus = 1) +\n    draw_circle(col = \"#00BFFF\", use = \"focus\", max.circle = 3) +\n    geom_edge_link0(aes(width = weight), edge_colour = \"grey66\") +\n    geom_node_point(aes(fill = clu, size = size), shape = 21) +\n    geom_node_text(aes(filter = (name == \"Ned\"), size = size, label = name),\n        family = \"serif\"\n    ) +\n    scale_edge_width_continuous(range = c(0.2, 1.2)) +\n    scale_size_continuous(range = c(1, 5)) +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = got_palette) +\n    coord_fixed() +\n    theme_graph() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](visualization_files/figure-html/concentric-ned1-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n`layout_with_centrality()` works in a similar way. You can specify any centrality index (or any numeric vector for that matter), and create a concentric layout where the most central nodes are put in the center and the most peripheral nodes in the biggest circle. The numeric attribute used for the layout is specified with the `cent` parameter. Here, we use the weighted degree\nof the characters.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggraph(gotS1, layout = \"centrality\", cent = graph.strength(gotS1)) +\n    geom_edge_link0(aes(edge_linewidth = weight), edge_colour = \"grey66\") +\n    geom_node_point(aes(fill = clu, size = size), shape = 21) +\n    geom_node_text(aes(size = size, label = name), family = \"serif\") +\n    scale_edge_width_continuous(range = c(0.2, 0.9)) +\n    scale_size_continuous(range = c(1, 8)) +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = got_palette) +\n    coord_fixed() +\n    theme_graph() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](visualization_files/figure-html/concentric-weighted-deg-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n(*Concentric layouts are not only helpful to focus on specific nodes, but also make for a \ngood tool to visualize ego networks.*)\n\n### Backbone layout\n\n`layout_as_backbone()` is a layout algorithm that can help emphasize hidden group structures.\nTo illustrate the performance of the algorithm, we create an artificial network with a subtle group structure using `sample_islands()` from `igraph`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ng <- sample_islands(9, 40, 0.4, 15)\ng <- simplify(g)\nV(g)$grp <- as.character(rep(1:9, each = 40))\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe network consists of 9 groups with 40 vertices each. The density within each group is\n0.4 and there are 15 edges running between each pair of groups. Let us try to\nvisualize the network with what we have learned so far.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggraph(g, layout = \"stress\") +\n  geom_edge_link0(edge_colour = \"black\", edge_linewidth = 0.1, edge_alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(fill = grp), shape = 21) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set1\") +\n  theme_graph() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](visualization_files/figure-html/island_stress-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs you can see, the graph seems to be a proper \"hairball\" without any special \nstructural features standing out. In this case, though, we know that there should be\n9 groups of vertices that are internally more densely connected than externally.\nTo uncover this group structure, we turn to the \"backbone layout\". \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbb <- layout_as_backbone(g, keep = 0.4)\nE(g)$col <- FALSE\nE(g)$col[bb$backbone] <- TRUE\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe idea of the algorithm is as follows. For each edge, an embededness score is calculated which serves as an\nedge weight attribute. These weights are then ordered and only the edges with the highest score are kept. The number of\nedges to keep is controlled with the `keep` parameter. In our example, we keep the top 40%. The parameter usually requires some experimenting to find out what works best. Since this\nmay result in an unconnected network, we add all edges of the union of all [maximum spanning trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_tree). The resulting network is the \"backbone\" of the original \nnetwork and the \"stress\" layout algorithm is applied to this network. Once the layout is calculated, all edges are added back to the network. \n\nThe output of the function are the x and y coordinates for nodes and a vector that gives the ids of the\nedges in the backbone network. In the code above, we use this vector to create a binary edge attribute that indicates if an edge is part of the backbone or not.\n\nTo use the coordinates, we set the `layout` parameter to \"manual\" and provide the x and y coordinates\nas parameters.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggraph(g, layout = \"manual\", x = bb$xy[, 1], y = bb$xy[, 2]) +\n    geom_edge_link0(aes(edge_colour = col), edge_linewidth = 0.1) +\n    geom_node_point(aes(fill = grp), shape = 21) +\n    scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set1\") +\n    scale_edge_color_manual(values = c(rgb(0, 0, 0, 0.3), rgb(0, 0, 0, 1))) +\n    theme_graph() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](visualization_files/figure-html/backbone-plot-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe groups are now clearly visible! Of course the network used in the example is specifically tailored to illustrate the power of the algorithm. Using the backbone layout in real world networks may not always result in such a clear division of groups.\nIt should thus not be seen as a universal remedy for drawing hairball networks. Keep in mind: It can **only** emphasize a hidden group structure **if it exists**.\n\nThe plot below shows an empirical example where the algorithm was able to uncover a hidden group structure. The network shows facebook friendships of a university in the US. Node colour corresponds to dormitory of students.\nLeft is the ordinary stress layout and right the backbone layout.\n\n![](assets/img/facebook.png)\n\n### Dynamic networks\n\nPeople regularly ask me if it is possible to animate a network evolution with `ggraph` and `gganimate`.\nUnfortunately this is not yet possible. But fear not! There is a way to still get it done with some \nhacking around the ggraph package. I will walk through this hack below but hope that it will eventually become obsolete.\n\nFor this part of the tutorial, you will need two additional packages.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(gganimate)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe will be using the *50 actor excerpt from the Teenage Friends and Lifestyle Study* from the [RSiena data repository](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/siena_datasets.htm) as an example.

You can basically use any type of layout for each network, but I'd recommend `layout_as_dynamic()` from my very own package {{graphlayouts}}. The algorithm calculates a reference layout\nwhich is a layout of the union of all networks and individual layouts based on stress minimization and combines those in a linear combination which is controlled by the `alpha` parameter. For `alpha=1`, only the reference layout is used and all graphs have the same layout. For `alpha=0`, the stress layout of each individual graph is used. Values in-between interpolate between the two layouts.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nxy <- layout_as_dynamic(s50, alpha = 0.2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nThis graph was created by an old(er) igraph version.\n  Call upgrade_graph() on it to use with the current igraph version\n  For now we convert it on the fly...\nThis graph was created by an old(er) igraph version.\n  Call upgrade_graph() on it to use with the current igraph version\n  For now we convert it on the fly...\nThis graph was created by an old(er) igraph version.\n  Call upgrade_graph() on it to use with the current igraph version\n  For now we convert it on the fly...\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow you could use {{ggraph}} and {{patchwork}} to produce a static plot with all networks side-by-side.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npList <- vector(\"list\", length(s50))\n\nfor (i in 1:length(s50)) {\n  pList[[i]] <- ggraph(s50[[i]], layout = \"manual\", x = xy[[i]][, 1], y = xy[[i]][, 2]) +\n    geom_edge_link0(edge_linewidth = 0.6, edge_colour = \"grey66\") +\n    geom_node_point(shape = 21, aes(fill = as.factor(smoke)), size = 6) +\n    geom_node_text(label = 1:50, repel = FALSE, color = \"white\", size = 4) +\n    scale_fill_manual(\n      values = c(\"forestgreen\", \"grey25\", \"firebrick\"),\n      guide = ifelse(i != 2, \"none\", \"legend\"),\n      name = \"smoking\",\n      labels = c(\"never\", \"occasionally\", \"regularly\")\n    ) +\n    theme_graph() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n    labs(title = paste0(\"Wave \", i))\n}\n\nwrap_plots(pList)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](visualization_files/figure-html/static_plot-1.png){width=1344}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis is nice but of course we want to animate the changes.

For instance, one level could be scientists and their collaborative ties and the\nsecond level are labs and ties among them, and inter-level edges are the affiliations of scientists and labs. \n\nThe `graphlayouts` package contains an artificial multilevel network which will be used to illustrate the algorithm.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(\"multilvl_ex\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe package assumes that a multilevel network has a vertex attribute called `lvl` which\nholds the level information (1 or 2). \n\nThe underlying algorithm of `layout_as_multilevel()` has three different versions, \nwhich can be used to emphasize different structural features of a multilevel network.\n\nIndependent of which option is chosen, the algorithm internally produces a 3D layout, where\neach level is positioned on a different y-plane. The 3D layout is then mapped to 2D with an [isometric projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric_projection).\nThe parameters `alpha` and `beta` control the perspective of the projection.\nThe default values seem to work for many instances, but may not always be optimal. \nAs a rough guideline: `beta` rotates the plot around the y axis (in 3D) and `alpha` moves the POV up or down.\n\n#### Complete layout\n\nA layout for the complete network can be computed via `layout_as_multilevel()` setting `type = \"all\"`.\nInternally, the algorithm produces a constrained 3D stress layout (each level on a different y plane) which is then \nprojected to 2D. This layout ignores potential differences in each level and optimizes only the overall layout.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nxy <- layout_as_multilevel(multilvl_ex, type = \"all\", alpha = 25, beta = 45)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nThis graph was created by an old(er) igraph version.\n  Call upgrade_graph() on it to use with the current igraph version\n  For now we convert it on the fly...\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo visualize the network with `ggraph`, you may want to draw the edges for each level (and inter level edges)\nwith a different edge geom.

Further reading\n\nThe tutorial \"Network Analysis and Visualization with R and igraph\"\nby Katherine Ognyanova [(link)](https://kateto.net/networks-r-igraph) comes with \nin-depth explanations of the built-in plotting function of `igraph`. \n\nFor further help on `ggraph` see the blog posts on layouts [(link)](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/ggraph-introduction-layouts/),\nnodes [(link)](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/ggraph-introduction-nodes/) and edges [(link)](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/ggraph-introduction-edges/) by `@thomasp85`. \nThomas is also the creator of `tidygraph` and there is also an introductory post on his blog [(link)](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/introducing-tidygraph/).\n\nMore details and algorithms of the `graphlayouts`
