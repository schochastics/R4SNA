```

## Data Preparation

As a running example, we use the network of characters in the first season of Game of Thrones (GoT). The dataset is included in the `networkdata` package.

```{r}
data("got")
gotS1 <- got[[1]]
```

We add some more node attributes to the GoT network that can be used for visualization purposes.

```{r}
#| label: prep_got
## define a custom color palette
got_palette <- c(
    "#1A5878", "#C44237", "#AD8941", "#E99093",
    "#50594B", "#8968CD", "#9ACD32"
)

## compute a clustering for node colors
V(gotS1)$clu <- as.character(membership(cluster_louvain(gotS1)))

## compute degree as node size
V(gotS1)$size <- degree(gotS1)
```

## Grammar of graphics

To master `ggraph` you need to understand the basics of, or at least develop a feeling for, the **grammar of graphics**. 
The grammar is implemented in R through `ggplot2` and provides a systematic framework for constructing visualizations by combining independent components. Rather than thinking of plots as pre-defined chart types, the grammar decomposes graphics into fundamental elements: data, aesthetic mappings, geometric objects, scales, and coordinate systems. This approach allows to build complex visualizations layer by layer, making it easier to customize and extend plots. For networks, `ggraph` extends this grammar to handle the unique structure of graph data, treating nodes and edges as separate geometric layers that can be styled and composed independently.

The code and figure below shows a standard network plot created with `ggraph`. We will go through the code step-by-step in the following sections to understand how to use each component effectively.

```{r}
#| label: fig-got-plot
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 6

ggraph(gotS1, layout = "stress") +
  geom_edge_link0(aes(edge_linewidth = weight), edge_colour = "grey66") +
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = clu, size = size), shape = 21) +
  geom_node_text(aes(filter = size >= 26, label = name), family = "serif") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = got_palette) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.2, 3)) +
  scale_size(range = c(1, 6)) +
  theme_graph() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```


## Layout

```r
ggraph(gotS1, layout = "stress")
```

The first layer includes the calculation of a **layout**. Unlike traditional data visualization where variables naturally map to x and y coordinates, networks usually lack inherent spatial positions. This makes choosing a layout algorithm the most fundamental decision in network visualization. Layout algorithms assign coordinates to 
nodes based on the network's structure, aiming to reveal patterns and relationships that support your analytical goals. 

The package `graphlayouts` provides a wide range of layout algorithms that can be used with `ggraph`. The "stress" layout for example is always a safe choice since it is deterministic and produces *nice* layouts for almost any graph. Beyond this fairly general layout, there are many more specialized algorithms included in `graphlayouts` that may be better suited for specific types of networks or analytical goals. These algorithms will be discussed later. The `igraph` package also provides a variety of standard layout algorithms, that can be used with `ggraph`. 

```r
c(
  "layout_with_dh", "layout_with_drl", "layout_with_fr",
  "layout_with_gem", "layout_with_graphopt", "layout_with_kk",
  "layout_with_lgl", "layout_with_mds", "layout_with_sugiyama",
  "layout_as_bipartite", "layout_as_star", "layout_as_tree"
)
```

To use any of these, you just need to use the last part of the name.
```r
ggraph(gotS1, layout = "dh") +
  ...
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-got-plot-layouts
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 10
#| echo: false

library(patchwork)

p1 <- ggraph(gotS1, layout = "dh") +
  geom_edge_link0(aes(edge_linewidth = weight), edge_colour = "grey66") +
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = clu, size = size), shape = 21) +
  geom_node_text(aes(filter = size >= 26, label = name), family = "serif") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = got_palette) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.2, 3)) +
  scale_size(range = c(1, 6)) +
  theme_graph() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  labs(title = "layout = 'dh'")

p2 <- ggraph(gotS1, layout = "kk") +
  geom_edge_link0(aes(edge_linewidth = weight), edge_colour = "grey66") +
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = clu, size = size), shape = 21) +
  geom_node_text(aes(filter = size >= 26, label = name), family = "serif") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = got_palette) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.2, 3)) +
  scale_size(range = c(1, 6)) +
  theme_graph() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  labs(title = "layout = 'kk'")

p3 <- ggraph(gotS1, layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link0(aes(edge_linewidth = weight), edge_colour = "grey66") +
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = clu, size = size), shape = 21) +
  geom_node_text(aes(filter = size >= 26, label = name), family = "serif") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = got_palette) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.2, 3)) +
  scale_size(range = c(1, 6)) +
  theme_graph() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  labs(title = "layout = 'fr'")

p4 <- ggraph(gotS1, layout = "mds") +
  geom_edge_link0(aes(edge_linewidth = weight), edge_colour = "grey66") +
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = clu, size = size), shape = 21) +
  geom_node_text(aes(filter = size >= 26, label = name), family = "serif") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = got_palette) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.2, 3)) +
  scale_size(range = c(1, 6)) +
  theme_graph() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  labs(title = "layout = 'mds'")


p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 + plot_layout(ncol = 2)
```


Note that there technically is no right or wrong choice. All layout algorithms are in a sense arbitrary since 
we can choose x and y coordinates freely as compared to ordinary data visualization where the "layout" is guided by existing "coordinates". For networks, it is mostly, but not exclusively, about aesthetics.

You can also precompute the layout with the `create_layout()` function. This makes sense in cases where the calculation
of the layout takes very long and you want to play around with other visual aspects. 

```r
gotS1_layout <- create_layout(gotS1 = "stress")

ggraph(gotS1_layout) +
  ...
```

## Edges

```r
geom_edge_link0(aes(width = weight), edge_colour = "grey66")
```

The second layer specifies how edges are drawn. To do so, we use one of the many edge geoms available in `ggraph`.
```r
c(
  "geom_edge_arc", "geom_edge_arc0", "geom_edge_arc2", "geom_edge_density",
  "geom_edge_diagonal", "geom_edge_diagonal0", "geom_edge_diagonal2",
  "geom_edge_elbow", "geom_edge_elbow0", "geom_edge_elbow2", "geom_edge_fan",
  "geom_edge_fan0", "geom_edge_fan2", "geom_edge_hive", "geom_edge_hive0",
  "geom_edge_hive2", "geom_edge_link", "geom_edge_link0", "geom_edge_link2",
  "geom_edge_loop", "geom_edge_loop0"
)
```
You can do a lot of fancy things with these geoms but for a standard network plot, you should almost always stick with `geom_edge_link0` since it simply draws a straight line between the endpoints. Some tools draw curved edges by default. While this may add some artistic value, it also reduces readability. It is best to always go with straight lines. If a network has multiple edges between two nodes, one can switch to `geom_edge_parallel()`.

```{r}
#| label: fig-parallel
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 6

g <- make_graph(c(1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2))

ggraph(g, layout = "stress") +
  geom_edge_parallel(edge_colour = "grey66", edge_linewidth = 0.5) +
  geom_node_point(size = 5) +
  theme_graph()
```

The curved equivalent of `geom_edge_parallel()` is `geom_edge_fan()`. The figure below shows the difference between the two.

```{r}
#| label: fig-fan
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 6

ggraph(g, layout = "stress") +
  geom_edge_fan(edge_colour = "grey66", edge_linewidth = 0.5) +
  geom_node_point(size = 5) +
  theme_graph()
```

Most edge geoms come in three flavors. The standard `geom_edge_link()` draws 100 dots on each edge compared to only two dots (the endpoints) in `geom_edge_link0()`. This is done to allow gradients along the edge. 

```{r}
#| label: fig-got-plot-grad
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 6
ggraph(gotS1, layout = "stress") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(alpha = after_stat(index)), edge_colour = "black") +
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = clu, size = size), shape = 21) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = got_palette) +
  scale_edge_width_continuous(range = c(0.2, 3)) +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(1, 6)) +
  theme_graph() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

The drawback of using `geom_edge_link()` is that the time to render the plot increases and so 
does the size of the file if you export the plot. Typically, you do not need gradients along an edge. Hence, `geom_edge_link0()` should be the default choice to draw edges.

Within `geom_edge_link0`, you can specify the appearance of the edge, either by mapping edge attributes to aesthetics
or setting them globally for the graph. Mapping attributes to aesthetics is done within `aes()`.
In the example, we map the edge width to the edge attribute "weight". `ggraph` then automatically scales the
edge width according to the attribute. The colour of all edges is globally set to "grey66".

The following aesthetics can be used within `geom_edge_link0` either within `aes()` or globally:

- edge_colour (colour of the edge)
- edge_linewidth  (width of the edge)
- edge_linetype (linetype of the edge, defaults to "solid")
- edge_alpha (opacity; a value between 0 and 1)

`ggraph` does not automatically draw arrows if your graph is directed. You need to do this manually using 
the arrow parameter.
```r
geom_edge_link0(aes(...), ...,
  arrow = arrow(
    angle = 30, length = unit(0.15, "inches"),
    ends = "last", type = "closed"
  )
)
```

The default arrowhead type is "open", yet "closed" usually has a nicer appearance.

```{r}
#| label: fig-arrow
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 6

g <- make_graph(c(1, 2, 2, 3), directed = TRUE)

ggraph(g, layout = "stress") +
  geom_edge_link0(
    edge_colour = "grey66", edge_linewidth = 0.5,
    arrow = arrow(
      angle = 30, length = unit(0.15, "inches"),
      ends = "last", type = "closed"
    )
  ) +
  geom_node_point(size = 5) +
  theme_graph()
```


## Nodes

```r
geom_node_point(aes(fill = clu, size = size), shape = 21) +
  geom_node_text(aes(filter = size >= 26, label = name), family = "serif")
```

On top of the edge layer, we draw the node layer. Always draw the node layer above 
the edge layer. Otherwise, edges will be visible on top of nodes.
There are slightly less geoms available for nodes.

```r
c(
  "geom_node_arc_bar", "geom_node_circle", "geom_node_label",
  "geom_node_point", "geom_node_text", "geom_node_tile", "geom_node_treemap"
)
```

The most important ones here are `geom_node_point()` to draw nodes as simple geometric objects (circles, squares,...)
and `geom_node_text()` to add node labels. You can also use `geom_node_label()`, but this draws labels within a box.

The mapping of node attributes to aesthetics is similar to edge attributes. In the example code, we map the fill attribute of the node shape to the "clu" attribute, which holds the result of a clustering, and the size of the nodes to the attribute "size". The shape of the node is globally set to 21.

The figure below shows all possible shapes that can be used for the nodes.

![](img/points-symbols.png)

Personally, I prefer "21" since it draws a border around the nodes. If you prefer another
shape, say "19", you have to be aware of several things. To change the color of shapes 1-20,
you need to use the colour parameter. For shapes 21-25 you need to use fill. The colour parameter 
only controls the border for these cases. 

The following aesthetics can be used within `geom_node_point()` either within `aes()` or globally:

- alpha  (opacity; a value between 0 and 1)
- colour (colour of shapes 0-20 and border colour for 21-25)
- fill  (fill colour for shape 21-25)
- shape (node shape; a value between 0 and 25)
- size (size of node)
- stroke (size of node border)

For `geom_node_text()`, there are a lot more options available, but the most important once are:

- label (attribute to be displayed as node label)
- colour (text colour)
- family (font to be used)
- size (font size)

Note that we also used a filter within `aes()` of `geom_node_text()`. The filter 
parameter allows you to specify a rule for when to apply the aesthetic mappings.
The most frequent use case is for node labels (but can also be used for edges or nodes).
In the example, we only display the node label if the size attribute is larger than 26.

## Scales

```r
scale_fill_manual(values = got_palette) +
  scale_edge_width_continuous(range = c(0.2, 3)) +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(1, 6))
```

The `scale_*` functions are used to control aesthetics that are mapped within `aes()`.
You do not necessarily need to set them, since `ggraph` can take care of it automatically.
```{r}
#| label: no-scales
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 6

ggraph(gotS1, layout = "stress") +
  geom_edge_link0(aes(edge_linewidth = weight), edge_colour = "grey66") +
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = clu, size = size), shape = 21) +
  geom_node_text(aes(filter = size >= 26, label = name), family = "serif") +
  theme_graph() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

While the node fill and size seem reasonable, the edges are a little too thick.
In general, it is always a good idea to add a `scale_*` for each aesthetic within `aes()`.

What kind of `scale_*` function you need depends on the aesthetic and on the type of attribute you are mapping.
Generally, scale functions are structured like this:  
`scale_<aes>_<variable type>()`.  

The "aes" part is easy. Just us the type you specified within `aes()`. For edges, however, you have to prepend `edge_`.
The "variable type" part depends on which scale the attribute is on. Before we continue, it may be 
a good idea to briefly discuss what aesthetics make sense for which variable type. 

| aesthetic | variable type | notes |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| node size | continuous | |
| edge width| continuous| |
| node colour/fill | categorical/continuous | use a gradient for continuous variables|
| edge colour | continuous | categorical only if there are different types of edges |
| node shape | categorical| only if there are a few categories (1-5). Colour should be the preferred choice|
| edge linetype| categorical | only if there are a few categories (1-5). Colour should be the preferred choice|
| node/edge alpha| continuous | |

The easiest to use scales are those for continuous variables mapped to edge width and node size (also the alpha value, which is not used here). While there are several parameters within `scale_edge_width_continuous()` and `scale_size_continuous()`, the
most important one is "range" which fixes the minimum and maximum width/size. It usually suffices to
adjust this parameter.

For continuous variables that are mapped to node/edge colour, you can use `scale_colour_gradient()`
`scale_colour_gradient2()` or `scale_colour_gradientn()` (add edge_ before colour for edge colours).
The difference between these functions is in how the gradient is constructed. `gradient` creates a two
colour gradient (low-high). Simply specify the the two colours to be used (e.g. low = "blue", high = "red").
`gradient2` creates a diverging colour gradient (low-mid-high) (e.g. low = "blue", mid = "white", high = "red") 
and `gradientn` a gradient consisting of more than three colours (specified with the colours parameter).

For categorical variables that are mapped to node colours (or fill in our example), you can
use `scale_fill_manual()`. This forces you to choose a color for each category yourself. 
Simply create a vector of colors (see the got_palette) and pass it to the function with the parameter values.

`ggraph` then assigns the colors in the order of the unique values of the categorical variable. This 
are either the factor levels (if the variable is a factor) or the result of sorting the unique values (if the variable is a character).
```{r}
#| label: order-color
sort(unique(V(gotS1)$clu))
```
If you want more control over which value is mapped to which colour, you can pass the vector of colours
as a named vector.
```{r}
#| label: named_palette
got_palette2 <- c(
    "5" = "#1A5878", "3" = "#C44237", "2" = "#AD8941",
    "1" = "#E99093", "4" = "#50594B", "7" = "#8968CD", "6" = "#9ACD32"
)
```

```{r}
#| label: got-plot-pal2
#| fig-width: 13
#| fig-height: 5
#| echo: false

library(patchwork)

ggraph(gotS1, layout = "stress") +
  geom_edge_link0(aes(edge_linewidth = weight), edge_colour = "grey66") +
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = clu, size = size), shape = 21) +
  geom_node_text(aes(filter = size >= 26, label = name), family = "serif") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = got_palette2) +
  scale_edge_width_continuous(range = c(0.2, 3)) +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(1, 6)) +
  theme_graph() +
  labs(title = "named palette") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") -> p2

ggraph(gotS1, layout = "stress") +
  geom_edge_link0(aes(edge_linewidth = weight), edge_colour = "grey66") +
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = clu, size = size), shape = 21) +
  geom_node_text(aes(filter = size >= 26, label = name), family = "serif") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = got_palette) +
  scale_edge_width_continuous(range = c(0.2, 3)) +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(1, 6)) +
  theme_graph() +
  labs(title = "unnamed palette") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") -> p1

p1 + p2
```

Using your own colour palette gives your network a unique touch. If you can't be bothered with 
choosing colours, you may want to consider `scale_fill_brewer()` and `scale_colour_brewer()`.
The function offers all palettes available at [colorbrewer2.org](http://colorbrewer2.org/). 

```{r}
#| label: got-plot-brewer
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 6
ggraph(gotS1, layout = "stress") +
  geom_edge_link0(aes(edge_linewidth = weight), edge_colour = "grey66") +
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = clu, size = size), shape = 21) +
  geom_node_text(aes(filter = size >= 26, label = name), family = "serif") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  scale_edge_width_continuous(range = c(0.2, 3)) +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(1, 6)) +
  theme_graph() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

(*Check out this [github repo](https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/r-color-palettes) from Emil Hvitfeldt for a comprehensive list of color palettes available in R*)

## Themes

```r
theme_graph() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

themes control the overall look of the plot. There are a lot of options within the `theme()`
function of `ggplot2`. Luckily, we really don't need any of those. `theme_graph()` is used
to erase all of the default ggplot theme (e.g. axis, background, grids, etc.) since they are irrelevant for networks. 
The only option worthwhile in `theme()` is `legend.position`, which we set to "none", i.e. don't show the legend.

The code below gives an example for a plot with a legend.
```{r}
#| label: got-plot-legend
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 6
ggraph(gotS1, layout = "stress") +
  geom_edge_link0(aes(edge_linewidth = weight), edge_colour = "grey66") +
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = clu, size = size), shape = 21) +
  geom_node_text(aes(filter = size >= 26, label = name), family = "serif") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = got_palette) +
  scale_edge_width_continuous(range = c(0.2, 3)) +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(1, 6)) +
  theme_graph() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

This covers all the necessary steps to produce a standard network plot with `ggraph`. More advanced techniques will be covered in the next sections. We conclude the introductory part by recreating a quite famous network visualization 

## Extended Example

In this section, we do a little code through to recreate the figure shown below.

![](img/polblogs_orig.png)
The network shows the linking between political blogs during the 2004 election in the US. Red nodes are conservative leaning blogs and blue ones liberal.

The dataset is included in the `networkdata` package.
```{r}
#| label:  data-polblogs
data("polblogs")

## add a vertex attribute for the indegree
V(polblogs)$deg <- degree(polblogs, mode = "in")
```

Let us start with a simple plot without any styling.
```{r}
#| label: polblogs1
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 8
lay <- create_layout(polblogs, "stress")

ggraph(lay) +
    geom_edge_link0(
        edge_linewidth = 0.2, edge_colour = "grey66",
        arrow = arrow(
            angle = 15, length = unit(0.15, "inches"),
            ends = "last", type = "closed"
        )
    ) +
    geom_node_point()
```

There is obviously a lot missing. First, we delete all isolates and plot again. 

```{r}
#| label: polblogs2
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 8
polblogs <- delete.vertices(polblogs, which(degree(polblogs) == 0))
lay <- create_layout(polblogs, "stress")

ggraph(lay) +
    geom_edge_link0(
        edge_linewidth = 0.2, edge_colour = "grey66",
        arrow = arrow(
            angle = 15, length = unit(0.1, "inches"),
            ends = "last", type = "closed"
        )
    ) +
    geom_node_point()
```

The original does feature a small disconnected component, but we remove this here.

```{r}
#| label: polblogs2a
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 8
comps <- components(polblogs)
polblogs <- delete.vertices(polblogs, which(comps$membership == which.min(comps$csize)))

lay <- create_layout(polblogs, "stress")
ggraph(lay) +
    geom_edge_link0(
        edge_linewidth = 0.2, edge_colour = "grey66",
        arrow = arrow(
            angle = 15, length = unit(0.15, "inches"),
            ends = "last", type = "closed"
        )
    ) +
    geom_node_point()
```


Better, let's start with some styling of the nodes.

```{r}
#| label: polblogs3
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 8
ggraph(lay) +
    geom_edge_link0(
        edge_linewidth = 0.2, edge_colour = "grey66",
        arrow = arrow(
            angle = 15, length = unit(0.15, "inches"),
            ends = "last", type = "closed"
        )
    ) +
    geom_node_point(shape = 21, aes(fill = pol))
```

The colors are obviously wrong, so we fix this with a `scale_fill_manual()`. Additionally,
we map the degree to node size.

```{r}
#| label: polblogs4
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 8
ggraph(lay) +
    geom_edge_link0(
        edge_linewidth = 0.2, edge_colour = "grey66",
        arrow = arrow(
            angle = 15, length = unit(0.15, "inches"),
            ends = "last", type = "closed"
        )
    ) +
    geom_node_point(shape = 21, aes(fill = pol, size = deg), show.legend = FALSE) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("left" = "#104E8B", "right" = "firebrick3"))
```

The node sizes are also not that satisfactory, so we fix the range with `scale_size()`.

```{r}
#| label: polblogs5
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 8
ggraph(lay) +
    geom_edge_link0(
        edge_linewidth = 0.2, edge_colour = "grey66",
        arrow = arrow(
            angle = 10, length = unit(0.1, "inches"),
            ends = "last", type = "closed"
        )
    ) +
    geom_node_point(shape = 21, aes(fill = pol, size = deg), show.legend = FALSE) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("left" = "#104E8B", "right" = "firebrick3")) +
    scale_size(range = c(0.5, 7))
```

Now we move on to the edges. This is a bit more complicated since we have to 
create an edge variable first which indicates if an edge is within or between political orientations.
This new variable is mapped to the edge color.

```{r}
#| label: polblogs6
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 8
el <- get.edgelist(polblogs, names = FALSE)
el_pol <- cbind(V(polblogs)$pol[el[, 1]], V(polblogs)$pol[el[, 2]])
E(polblogs)$col <- ifelse(el_pol[, 1] == el_pol[, 2], el_pol[, 1], "mixed")


lay <- create_layout(polblogs, "stress")
ggraph(lay) +
    geom_edge_link0(
        edge_linewidth = 0.2, aes(edge_colour = col),
        arrow = arrow(
            angle = 10, length = unit(0.1, "inches"),
            ends = "last", type = "closed"
        )
    ) +
    geom_node_point(shape = 21, aes(fill = pol, size = deg), show.legend = FALSE) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("left" = "#104E8B", "right" = "firebrick3")) +
    scale_size(range = c(0.5, 7))
```

Similar to the node colors, we add a `scale_edge_colour_manual()` to adjust the edge colors.

```{r}
#| label: polblogs7
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 8
ggraph(lay) +
    geom_edge_link0(
        edge_linewidth = 0.2, aes(edge_colour = col),
        arrow = arrow(
            angle = 10, length = unit(0.1, "inches"),
            ends = "last", type = "closed"
        ), show.legend = FALSE
    ) +
    geom_node_point(shape = 21, aes(fill = pol, size = deg), show.legend = FALSE) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("left" = "#104E8B", "right" = "firebrick3")) +
    scale_edge_colour_manual(values = c("left" = "#104E8B", "mixed" = "goldenrod", "right" = "firebrick3")) +
    scale_size(range = c(0.5, 7))
```

Almost, but it seems there are a lot of yellow edges which run over blue edges. It looks as
if these should run below according to the original viz. To achieve this, we use a filter trick.
We add two `geom_edge_link0()` layers: First, for the mixed edges and then for the remaining edges.
In that way, the mixed edges are getting plotted below.

```{r}
#| label: polblogs8
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 8
ggraph(lay) +
    geom_edge_link0(
        edge_linewidth = 0.2, aes(filter = (col == "mixed"), edge_colour = col),
        arrow = arrow(
            angle = 10, length = unit(0.1, "inches"),
            ends = "last", type = "closed"
        ), show.legend = FALSE
    ) +
    geom_edge_link0(
        edge_linewidth = 0.2, aes(filter = (col != "mixed"), edge_colour = col),
        arrow = arrow(
            angle = 10, length = unit(0.1, "inches"),
            ends = "last", type = "closed"
        ), show.legend = FALSE
    ) +
    geom_node_point(shape = 21, aes(fill = pol, size = deg), show.legend = FALSE) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("left" = "#104E8B", "right" = "firebrick3")) +
    scale_edge_colour_manual(values = c("left" = "#104E8B", "mixed" = "goldenrod", "right" = "firebrick3")) +
    scale_size(range = c(0.5, 7))
```

Now lets just add the `theme_graph()`.
```{r}
#| label: polblogs9
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 8
ggraph(lay) +
    geom_edge_link0(
        edge_linewidth = 0.2, aes(filter = (col == "mixed"), edge_colour = col),
        arrow = arrow(
            angle = 10, length = unit(0.1, "inches"),
            ends = "last", type = "closed"
        ), show.legend = FALSE
    ) +
    geom_edge_link0(
        edge_linewidth = 0.2, aes(filter = (col != "mixed"), edge_colour = col),
        arrow = arrow(
            angle = 10, length = unit(0.1, "inches"),
            ends = "last", type = "closed"
        ), show.legend = FALSE
    ) +
    geom_node_point(shape = 21, aes(fill = pol, size = deg), show.legend = FALSE) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("left" = "#104E8B", "right" = "firebrick3")) +
    scale_edge_colour_manual(values = c("left" = "#104E8B", "mixed" = "goldenrod", "right" = "firebrick3")) +
    scale_size(range = c(0.5, 7)) +
    theme_graph()
```
