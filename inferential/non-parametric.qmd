The choice between parametric and non-parametric methods should be guided by the research objectives, the characteristics of the data, and the degree of theoretical certainty. 

Parametric models are best suited for situations where researchers have strong theoretical expectations about the data and where the assumptions required by the models can reasonably be defended. These models offer the advantages of explanatory depth, predictive power, and simulation capacity.

Non-parametric methods, on the other hand, provide greater flexibility and robustness. They are ideal for preliminary data exploration, hypothesis testing in complex systems, and validating results derived from more rigid parametric models.

In practice, the most robust network analyses often combine both approaches: **parametric models** to generate and test hypotheses about network formation, and **non-parametric methods** to assess the robustness and generalizability of findings. Together, they form a comprehensive toolkit for understanding the structure and dynamics of social networks.

## Parametric Approaches

Parametric methods rely on the assumption that network data conform to a theoretical probability distribution. This enables researchers to evaluate network statistics—such as centrality, density, or clustering—within a well-defined probabilistic framework. The advantage of this approach lies in its ability to produce interpretable and powerful models, particularly when the underlying assumptions about the data are met.

In network analysis, parametric models often incorporate the inherent dependencies among ties. For instance, exponential random graph models (ERGMs) and stochastic actor-based models are designed to account for social processes like reciprocity, transitivity, or homophily. These models not only describe observed network structures but also allow researchers to infer the generative mechanisms that shape them. When the theoretical model is appropriate and adequately specified, parametric methods can yield strong predictive insights and support formal hypothesis testing.

## Non-Parametric Approaches

In contrast, non-parametric approaches avoid making strong assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data. These methods are especially valuable when working with real-world networks that are too complex, noisy, or irregular to fit neatly into a parametric mold. Rather than relying on predefined distributions, non-parametric approaches use data-driven techniques to generate reference distributions, often through permutation or resampling methods.

A common strategy in non-parametric network analysis involves shuffling network ties while preserving certain summary characteristics, such as the number of nodes or degree distribution. This process creates a "null model" against which the observed network can be compared. The resulting p-values retain their conventional interpretation: they represent the probability of observing a network statistic as extreme as the one obtained, assuming the null hypothesis is true. This allows researchers to test hypotheses about network structure without assuming a specific generative model.

Non-parametric methods are particularly useful in exploratory analyses or when assessing the robustness of findings derived from parametric models. They provide a flexible framework for evaluating whether observed patterns—such as high clustering or assortative mixing—are statistically meaningful or likely to have arisen by chance.

## Choosing the Right Approach

The choice between parametric and non-parametric methods should be guided by the research context. Parametric models are well suited for situations where theoretical knowledge is strong and where the assumptions of the model can be reasonably defended. They provide powerful tools for explanation and prediction. On the other hand, non-parametric methods offer greater flexibility and fewer assumptions, making them ideal for preliminary analysis, model validation, or studies involving complex and poorly understood networks.

In many cases, the most robust strategy involves combining both approaches: using parametric models to generate hypotheses and explanations, and non-parametric tools to test the sensitivity and validity of those results. Together, these methods form a complementary toolkit for the rigorous analysis of network data.
