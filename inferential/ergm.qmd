# Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs)
In real social networks, however, ties are often **dependent** on one another. The formation of one tie may increase or decrease the likelihood of another. For example, two people who share a common friend may be more likely to form a tie themselves (triadic closure), or individuals may be more likely to reciprocate a connection that is initiated by someone else. These kinds of dependencies are central to many **social theories**, and they give rise to complex patterns of **self-organization** in networks.

To capture these processes, we need a more flexible modeling frameworkâ€”one that allows for:

- Multiple network features to be modeled simultaneously
- Direct specification of tie dependencies
- Testing of competing social mechanisms

This leads us to models that are built around network configurations, i.e. small, interpretable patterns of ties (such as mutual ties, stars, and triangles) that collectively describe the structure of the network. These configurations are often nested, meaning they build on one another hierarchically, and they can represent competing explanations for the observed structure. For instance, both reciprocity and popularity could explain why a node has many incoming tie, but these explanations imply different underlying processes.

By explicitly modeling such configurations, we gain not only better empirical fit but also the ability to test theoretical hypotheses about the generative processes that shape real-world networks. This chapter introduces a class of models designed for this purpose: **Exponential Random Graph models (ERGMs)**.
