# Introduction

When we look at a network, we don’t just want to describe what we see. We want to understand why the connections exist and how they shape the bigger picture. That’s where statistical network models come in.
Unlike purely descriptive approaches, models enable us to infer the underlying processes that generate network structures. 

What makes modeling a powerful statistical tool is that they don’t just  summarize the data we already have, but instead dig deeper to uncover the hidden rules that shape the network. They let us test ideas, explore patterns, and even predict how networks might evolve. Of course, no model can fully capture the complexity of the real world, but they provide useful blueprints for understanding the mechanisms forming and driving the system.
