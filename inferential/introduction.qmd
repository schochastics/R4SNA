# Introduction

Statistical (network) models provide a way to describe and analyze data that goes beyond simple observations. Unlike purely descriptive approaches, models enable us to infer the underlying mechanisms that generate network structures. By incorporating theoretical assumptions and hypotheses, statistical models offer a mathematical representation of the rules governing a system.  

The value of statistical models lies in their ability to extend beyond observed data. They are tools for testing hypotheses and understanding how networks form, evolve, and function. While no model can perfectly represent real-world networks, they offer simplified frameworks that help us understand the key patterns behind interactions and relationships.
