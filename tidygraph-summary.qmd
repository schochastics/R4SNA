# Summary

The tidy framework works well in general but there are some shortcomings. So far, only
basic network analytic methods are supported. This is enough for many tasks but as soon as more 
advanced techniques are needed, you are forced to switch to the "untidy" way again. A lot of 
coding but also conceptual work is needed to advance the framework further. For instance, how do ERGMs or SAOMs fit into this? Maybe there is a way to use `tidymodels`, but that is beyond the scope for now.
